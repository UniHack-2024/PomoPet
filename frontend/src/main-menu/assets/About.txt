Pomo Pet is based on the Pomodoro technique.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by 
five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals.

Each work interval is called a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato.

Here is specifically how Pomo Pet works:
Step 1: Pick a task.
Step 2: Press the Start Studying Button.
Step 3: While Pomo Pet is sleeping work on the task you picked for 25min!
Step 4: You're ready to take a break and Pomo Pet is now awake and wants to play a game with you.
Step 5: Repeat 4 times or for 2 hours all together.
Step 6: Now you have had enough time studying, its time to exercise like for example going for a walk, and Pomo Pet thinks thats a great idea as well.
Step 7: Compare with your friends!
